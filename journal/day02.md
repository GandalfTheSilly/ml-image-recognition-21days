Here what I’ve done at day 1:

Today, I created two small Python CLI projects.

Project 1 (Username & Age Checker):
I wrote a script that asks the user for a username and age, then checks if the age input is valid using isdigit(). If the input is not a number, the program shows an error message and asks again. After converting the age to an integer, it classifies the user as an adult (18+) or minor and prints the result. While testing, I noticed a small mistake in the error message (it said “name” instead of “age”), and I fixed it.

Project 2 (Calculator CLI):
I also built a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+ - * /) from the user. It validates inputs, prevents crashes (like division by zero), and lets the user continue doing new calculations until they choose to quit.
