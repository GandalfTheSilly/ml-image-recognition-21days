Here what I've done at day 1:

Today, I wrote a Python script that asks the user for a username and age, then checks if the age input is a valid number using isdigit(). If the input is invalid, it shows an error message and asks again. After converting the age to an integer, the program decides whether the user is an adult (18+) or a minor and prints the result. I learned how input validation works in Python, but I noticed a small issue in the error message where it says “name” instead of “age.” Git commands I used: git status, git add ., git commit -m "Day 1 done".
